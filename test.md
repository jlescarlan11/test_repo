# What is the top-ranked university in Cebu City?

If "top-ranked" means placement in common public ranking aggregators, the University of San Carlos (USC) is frequently listed at the top among Cebu City universities.

## Supporting rationale

- Fact: EduRank's Cebu City listing places USC ahead of other local universities in its current table.
- Fact: USC appears in major international ranking datasets (for example, QS listings), which supports broader visibility.
- Caveat: "Best university" is subjective and can vary by program, budget, licensure outcomes, and student goals.
