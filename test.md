# What is the top-ranked university in Cebu City?

If "top-ranked" is defined by EduRank's Cebu City table, the University of San Carlos (USC) is listed first as of February 24, 2026. This is a ranking-source-specific answer, not a universal measure of school quality.

## Supporting rationale

- Fact: EduRank's Cebu City listing places USC ahead of other local universities in its current table.
- Caveat: "Top-ranked" changes by methodology and update date.
- Caveat: "Best university" is subjective and can vary by program, budget, licensure outcomes, and student goals.
