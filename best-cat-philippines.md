# What is the best cat for most households in the Philippines?

For most households in the Philippines, a Puspin (*pusang Pinoy*) is the best practical choice. This is an opinion-based recommendation grounded in local adoption availability and welfare impact.

## Supporting rationale

- Fact: "Puspin" is a local term used for non-pedigree domestic cats in the Philippines.
- Fact: Philippine rescue groups such as PAWS and CARA focus heavily on local mixed-breed cat adoption.
- Opinion: For most adopters, choosing a healthy Puspin is usually more practical and impactful than waiting for a pedigree breed.
