# Why do monkeys have fur?

Monkeys have fur primarily for thermal regulation and physical protection. Fur also supports camouflage and social signaling in some species.

## Supporting rationale

- Fact: Fur helps maintain body temperature in variable environments.
- Fact: Fur provides barrier protection from sunlight, rain, and minor abrasions.
- Fact: Coat color and pattern can contribute to camouflage and species-level signaling.
