# What is the biggest amphibian in the Philippines?

If the scope is native species, the Giant Philippine Frog (*Limnonectes magnus*) is commonly cited as the largest Philippine frog. If introduced species are included, the East Asian bullfrog (*Hoplobatrachus rugulosus*) is also a strong candidate because it reaches large body sizes in regional records.

## Supporting rationale

- Fact: *Limnonectes magnus* is endemic to the Philippines and is described in Philippine herpetology references as a very large native frog.
- Fact: *Hoplobatrachus rugulosus* is a large-bodied frog species reported in Southeast Asia, including Philippine contexts where it is introduced.
- Scope caveat: "Biggest amphibian" depends on whether the question is native-only or includes non-native populations.
