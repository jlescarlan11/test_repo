# Biggest amphibian in the Philippines

**Short answer:** If you mean native amphibians, the Giant Philippine Frog (*Limnonectes magnus*) is commonly cited as the country’s largest frog and is endemic to the Philippines. citeturn0search2turn0search44  
**If you include introduced species**, the East Asian bullfrog (*Hoplobatrachus rugulosus*) has documented snout–vent lengths of about 100–150 mm in Philippine field studies, which makes it one of the largest amphibians currently present. citeturn0search45turn0search48

## Details and evidence

- **Native largest (commonly cited): Giant Philippine Frog, *Limnonectes magnus*.** A Philippine herpetology reference site (non‑academic) notes it as the largest frog in the Philippines and gives a size range of **51–150 mm snout–vent length (SVL)**; this species is endemic to the Philippines. citeturn0search2turn0search44
- **Typical sizes reported in local studies for *L. magnus* can be smaller** (e.g., average SVL around **61 mm** in one field study), which suggests that “largest” is based on maximum size records rather than typical individuals. citeturn0search47
- **Introduced large species:** *Hoplobatrachus rugulosus* (East Asian bullfrog) is an introduced species in the Philippines and is described as large-bodied, with reported **SVL commonly ~100–150 mm** in a Philippine study, and high adult sizes reported in the broader literature. citeturn0search45turn0search48

## Bottom line

- **If you mean the largest native amphibian:** the **Giant Philippine Frog (*Limnonectes magnus*)** is the best-supported answer in Philippine sources. citeturn0search2turn0search44
- **If you mean the largest amphibian currently found in the Philippines (including non‑native species):** the **East Asian bullfrog (*Hoplobatrachus rugulosus*)** is likely the largest based on documented size ranges in Philippine field data. citeturn0search45turn0search48
