# Cebu City University Ranking Note

Source-controlled documentation for a single, evidence-based claim:
which university is most consistently top-ranked in Cebu City, Philippines.

## Purpose

This repository exists to keep one short research note accurate, scoped, and publishable.
It is intentionally minimal and should not evolve into a general knowledge base.

## Authoritative Content

- [`test.md`](./test.md): Primary note containing the claim and supporting rationale.
- [`README.md`](./README.md): Repository policy, workflow, and quality gates.

Files outside this scope are non-authoritative and should not be treated as research outputs.

## Claim Scope

The note evaluates "best university in Cebu City" using repeatability across public rankings, not personal preference.

Evaluation lens:
- Cebu City relevance
- Visibility in national/international ranking systems
- Cross-source consistency over time

Out of scope:
- Program-specific rankings
- Tuition/value judgments
- Non-evidence-based preferences

## Editorial Policy

All updates must follow these rules:

- Keep claims factual, bounded, and time-aware.
- Avoid universal wording unless directly supported by evidence.
- Exclude unrelated content from the primary note.
- Prefer concise language over narrative commentary.

## Update Workflow

1. Verify source freshness and methodology changes.
2. Update [`test.md`](./test.md) only if evidence changes the conclusion or confidence.
3. Ensure the note contains only in-scope content.
4. Update this README when governance or process changes.
5. Commit with a clear, audit-friendly message.

## Release Readiness Checklist

Before merge or publication:

- All cited sources are current and correctly interpreted.
- The claim and rationale in `test.md` are internally consistent.
- `test.md` contains no unrelated text.
- Markdown renders correctly in a standard viewer.

## Repository Layout

- [`README.md`](./README.md): Production documentation for standards and operations.
- [`test.md`](./test.md): Canonical research note.
- `best-cat-philippines.md`: Unscoped draft content (non-authoritative).
