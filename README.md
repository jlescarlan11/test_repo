# Philippines Topic Notes

A markdown-first repository of concise, evidence-oriented notes on Philippines-focused topics.

## Overview

This project stores reference notes, not application code. Each file addresses one focused question and presents a clear conclusion with supporting rationale.

## Contents

- [`best-cat-philippines.md`](./best-cat-philippines.md): Cat breed guidance for Philippine conditions.
- [`biggest-amphibian-philippines.md`](./biggest-amphibian-philippines.md): Largest amphibian analysis in native vs introduced context.
- [`test.md`](./test.md): Note on the top-ranked university in Cebu City.
- [`why-do-monkeys-have-fur.md`](./why-do-monkeys-have-fur.md): Biological function of fur in monkeys.

## Editorial Standards

All notes should meet the following standards:

- Open with a direct short answer.
- Cover a single primary question per file.
- Separate factual claims from opinion.
- Cite current, verifiable sources for factual claims.
- Use concise, neutral language.

## Note Template

1. `#` Title with the exact question or topic
2. Short answer (1-3 sentences)
3. Supporting rationale (bulleted)
4. Sources
5. Optional caveats or scope limits

## Contribution Process

1. Select one note to add or revise.
2. Verify claims and refresh outdated sources.
