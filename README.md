# Cebu City University Ranking Note

A concise, source-based writeup identifying the most consistently top-ranked university in Cebu City, Philippines.

## Purpose
This repository contains a short research note that answers:

- Which university is the best in Cebu City under widely cited public rankings?

The current conclusion in `test.md` identifies **University of San Carlos (USC)** as the strongest overall candidate based on recurring ranking presence.

## Repository Structure
- `README.md`: Project overview, standards, and maintenance guidance.
- `test.md`: Primary note containing the claim and supporting rationale.

## Methodology
The note uses a practical definition of “best” based on observable ranking consistency:

- City-level ranking presence (Cebu City context)
- National/international ranking visibility
- Cross-source consistency over a single-source opinion

## How To Use
1. Open `test.md`.
2. Review the main claim and justification.
3. Validate cited ranking sources before reuse in external publications.

## Quality Standards
To keep this repository production-ready:

- Keep statements evidence-based and clearly scoped.
- Avoid absolute claims without a source and date context.
- Update wording when rankings or methodologies change.
- Use plain, concise language suitable for public sharing.

## Maintenance Workflow
1. Re-check referenced rankings.
2. Update the conclusion text in `test.md` if evidence changes.
3. Reflect any scope or process updates in `README.md`.
4. Record meaningful changes with clear commit messages.
