# Cebu City University Ranking Note

Documentation repository for a short, source-based claim about which university is most consistently top-ranked in Cebu City, Philippines.

## Scope

This repo maintains one primary note:

- [`test.md`](./test.md): Current conclusion and rationale.

The note currently identifies **University of San Carlos (USC)** as the strongest candidate under a consistency-based ranking lens.

## Evaluation Criteria

The claim uses a practical definition of "best" based on repeated visibility across public ranking sources:

- Cebu City relevance
- National and international ranking presence
- Cross-source consistency

This repository does not claim a universal or permanent "best" institution. Conclusions are time-sensitive and source-dependent.

## Editorial Standards

Use these standards for all updates:

- Keep statements factual, scoped, and dated when needed.
- Avoid absolute language without clear evidence.
- Separate claim text from unrelated content.
- Keep wording concise and publication-ready.

## Update Procedure

1. Re-validate cited rankings and their latest methodology.
2. Update [`test.md`](./test.md) only when evidence materially changes.
3. Update this README if scope, process, or standards change.
4. Commit changes with clear, audit-friendly messages.

## Verification Checklist

Before merging documentation changes:

- Sources are current and correctly represented.
- Claims in `test.md` match cited evidence.
- No unrelated text is mixed into the research note.
